### Orbital Dynamics

A web app that allows you to input thrust forces and thrust duration for a spacecraft in orbit and see its trajectory animated relative to a target object; returning the amount of fuel used and closest distance to the target.

Originally starting as a University project to calculate the trajectories of spacecraft to intercept debris, I decided to evolve the Python scripts into a Web App to provide a fun and visual user experience.

Variable names are designed to mirror their mathematical notation so for a more in depth explanation and derivation see 'OrbitalDynamicsEssay.pdf'.
